      <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This paragraph inserted to test if pr preview is working - <strong>Do not merge!</strong></p>
<p>W3C is a <strong>growing and global community</strong> where participants
choose to work together, and in that process experience differences in
language, location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment,
misunderstandings and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be resolved
informally. In rare cases, however, behavior can intimidate, harass, or
otherwise disrupt one or more people in the community, which W3C will not
tolerate.</p>

<p>A <strong>Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</strong> is useful to
define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of
professional practice. It also provides a benchmark for self evaluation and
acts as a vehicle for better identity of the organization.</p>

<p>This code (<strong>CEPC</strong>), complemented by a set of <a
href="/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures">Procedures</a>, applies to any member of the
W3C community â€“ staff, members, invited experts, participants in W3C
meetings, W3C teleconferences, W3C mailing lists, W3C conference or W3C
functions, etc. Note that this code complements rather than replaces legal
rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation.</p>

<p><a href="/Consortium/pwe/#Education">Education and training materials</a>
are available from the <a href="/Consortium/pwe/">Positive Work Environment
public homepage</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Statement" id="Statement">Statement</a> of Intent</h2>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">W3C is committed to maintain a
<strong>positive</strong> work environment. This commitment calls for a
workplace where <a href="#Participant">participants</a> at all levels
<strong>behave</strong> according to the rules of the following code. A
foundational concept of this code is that <strong>we all share
responsibility</strong> for our <a href="#Work">work environment</a>.</p>

    of others and the <a

    of data you access.</li>
  <li>With respect to cultural differences, be conservative in what you do and
    liberal in what you accept from others, but not to the point of accepting
    disrespectful, unprofessional or unfair or <a href="#Unwelcome">unwelcome
    behavior</a> or <a href="#Advance">advances</a>.</li>
  <li>Promote the rules of this Code and take action (especially if you are in
