        This is an editors' draft; a Work in Progress which will be submitted to W3C
	as a proposed update to the currently operational version of the
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Conduct</a>.

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        W3C is a growing and global community where <a>participants</a> choose
        to work together. W3C is committed to maintaining a positive working
        environment, where each participant feels appreciated and respected and
        where everyone adheres to the same high level of standards of personal
        behavior. In that process we experience differences in language,
        location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment,
        misunderstandings and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be
        resolved informally.
      </p>
        W3C's <cite>Code of Conduct</cite>
        (<abbr title="Code of Conduct">CoC</abbr>) is
        useful to define accepted and <a>acceptable behaviors</a> and to
        promote high standards of professional practice. The goal of this code
        of conduct is to ensure that W3C is an environment where everyone who
        participates is treated equitably and with respect, including being able to participate without fear of <a>harassment</a>. It also provides a
        benchmark for self evaluation and acts as a vehicle for better identity
        of the organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CoC (or "code") is complemented by a set of <a href=
        "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures">Procedures</a> and applies
        to any member of the W3C community – staff, members, invited experts,
        and <a>participants</a> in W3C meetings, W3C teleconferences, W3C
        mailing lists, code repositories, W3C conferences or W3C functions, etc.
        Note that this code complements rather than replaces legal rights and
        obligations pertaining to any particular situation.

        <h3>
          Updates to the CoC
        </h3>
        <p>
          The CoC is maintained by the Positive Work Environment Community Group. In order to keep the CoC up to date with the needs and scope of W3C, PWE will routinely review and update the CoC as needed. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In March of each year, the CoC Review Period will open. During this period PWE will work with W3C members, ombudspeople, and the Advisory Board and Advisory Committee to intake and review any issues or recommendations for changes to CoC. This period of review will last 3 months, and should changes be required, PWE will deliver a new version of the CoC to the Advisory Board by the end of July.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have any concerns or issues with CoC, they can be logged at any time in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/PWETF/">PWE GitHub repository</a> at any time.

        Statement of Intent
      </h2>
      <p>
        W3C is committed to maintaining a <strong>positive</strong> work environment for all, including and especially those from historically marginalized communities. This commitment calls for a workplace where
        <a>participants</a> at all levels behave according to the rules of the
        following code. A foundational concept of this code is that <em>we all
        share responsibility</em> for our work environment.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>
        Code
      </h2>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Expected Behavior
        </h3>

        <p>
          Treat each other with respect,
          professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences
          and strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Appreciate and accommodate our similarities and differences. We
          come from many cultures and backgrounds, ways of life, and standards
          of behavior. Cultural differences can encompass everything from
          official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be
          respectful of people with different practices, attitudes, and
          beliefs. To help us achieve and maintain these high standards, each
          individual participant is expected to share responsibility for our
          work environment by adhering to the behavioral guidelines herein.
          </li>
          <li>Have empathy when discussing sensitive issues. Some participants
          may have experienced (or been subjected to) various forms of violence
          in their lives, which may cause distress when they are reminded of
          it. Avoid making jokes or callously mentioning sexual violence such
          as stalking or sexual assault; in cases when the need arises to
          discuss these issues and how they affect people - do so with tact and
          empathy taking into account the gravity of the situation, and make
          sure that <a>participants</a> are appropriately warned in advance so
          they can choose to step out of these discussions.
          </li>
          <li>Treat everyone with respect. We are a large community of people who are passionate
          about our work, sometimes holding strong opinions and beliefs. We are
          committed to dealing with each other with courtesy, respect, and
          dignity at all times. Misunderstandings and disagreements do happen.
          When conflicts arise, we are expected to resolve them maintaining
          that courtesy, respect, and dignity, even when emotions are
          heightened.
          </li>
          <li>Do not accept or engage in abusive behavior in any form, whether it is
        verbal, physical, sexual, or implied.</li>
          <li>Be honest. Be truthful, sincere, forthright and, unless professional duties require confidentiality or special discretion, candid, straightforward, and frank.</li>
          <li>Be inclusive and promote <a>diversity</a>. Seek diverse
          perspectives. Diversity of views and of people powers innovation,
          even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new
          perspectives be heard and listen actively. 
          </li>
          <li>Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the
          group. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and
          encourage other voices to join in. Provide alternative ways to
          contribute.
          </li>
          <li>Be aware that displays of affection may complicate professional
          relationships. For some cultures, overtly friendly disposition
          towards another participant involving body contact (e.g.: hugging,
          touching on the arm or shoulder, or kissing) is uncommon and may be
          perceived as an invasion of personal space, or as unwelcome advances.
          </li>
          <li>Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices, and discriminatory
          practices.
          </li>
          <li>Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred
          names, titles (including pronouns), and the appropriate tone of
          voice. Therefore, be formal and conservative in what you do and
          liberal in what you accept from others and acknowledge the
          contributions of your peers.
          </li>
		      <li>Accommodate participants' needs for physical distancing and other accommodations or precautions due to health concerns such as immune deficiency, allergies, or chemical sensitivity.</li>
          <li>Be sensitive to language differences. English is the default
          language of the W3C. However, only some of us are native English
          speakers. Many <a>participants</a> speak English as a second (or
          third) language. People who communicate in non-native language often
          struggle to understand fast and/or quiet speech and may speak louder
          than they usually would when communicating in their native tongue. If
          someone struggles to express their thoughts, help ensure their ideas
          are adequately expressed, heard, and granted thorough consideration.
          </li>
          <li>Respect confidentiality and privacy. Sometimes, matters we discuss may
          fall under various <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/#confidentiality-levels">confidentiality</a>
          agreements and strict adherence to these agreements is expected. In
          addition, certain pieces of information disclosed in a group setting
          may be private in nature, or we may inadvertently learn confidential
          information accidentally disclosed by other participants. Please
          exercise good judgment, and make reasonable efforts to protect
          privacy and confidentiality of all participants.

          Unacceptable Behavior
        </h3>
        <p>
          <dfn>Unacceptable behaviors</dfn> run counter to the Code
          of Conduct. This list of <a>unacceptable
          behaviors</a> does not cover every case. Each person you interact
          with is unique, and behavior must be assessed on an individual level.
          Ensuring that your behavior does not have a negative impact is your
          responsibility. W3C strictly prohibits <a>discrimination</a>,
          intimidation, <a>harassment</a>, and <a>bullying</a> of any kind and
          on any basis.
        </p>

          practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs,
          and employment
          </li>
          <li><a>Misgendering</a> someone by deliberately referring to a person
            using the wrong pronouns or by using someone's proper names or
            other terms that person has asked not to be used, also known as
            <a>deadnaming</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where
          they are not appropriate.
          </li>
          <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (e.g., textual
          descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without <a>consent</a> or after
          a request to stop.

            activity for <a>harassment</a> purposes.
          </li>
          <li>Sustained disruption of discussion. This may include, but
          is not limited to, various common methods of engaging in bad
          faith discourse such as:

              <li>Continuing to raise issues that were not accepted by the group consensus. It you feel you have important new information or that your argument did not get a fair hearing, then contact the chairs. Otherwise, accept the group consensus and move on.

          <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
          </li>

          </li>
          <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication without
          <a>consent</a> by the involved parties.
          </li>
          <li>Use of coded language (also known as "dog whistles") used to
          rally support for hate groups or to intimidate vulnerable groups.
          </li>
          <li><a>Patronizing</a> language or behavior:
            <ul>
              <li>Intentionally or unintentionally making assumptions about the skills or knowledge of others, such as using language that implies the audience is uninformed on a topic (e.g. interjections like "I can't believe you don't know about [topic]").
              </li>
              <li>Assuming that particular groups of people are technically unskilled due to their characteristics (e.g., “So easy your grandmother could do it”, which implies an older woman might not be technically competent).
              </li>
              <li>Interrupting or repeatedly commenting in conversations with unneccessary clarifications or comments on audience behaviour (e.g. "I don't think you understood my previous comment...", grammar or language corrections that were not invited).</li>

          </li>
          <li>Microaggressions, which are small comments or questions, either
          intentional or unintentional, that marginalize people by

	<h3>Safety versus Comfort</h3>
        <p>This Code prioritizes the safety of individuals, particularly those in marginalized communities, over the comfort of others. We will prioritize safety in situations such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"Reverse" -isms, including "reverse racism," "reverse
          <a>sexism</a>," and "cisphobia".
          </li>
          <li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,”
          “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”.
          </li>
          <li>Communication in a tone you don’t find congenial.
          </li>
          <li>Criticisms of racist, sexist, <a>cissexist</a>, or otherwise
          oppressive behavior or assumptions.

        Reporting Violations and Supporting the Code
      </h2>
      <p>
        If you are concerned about your immediate safety, contact <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emergency_telephone_numbers">local
        emergency services</a>. For a face to face event you may need to contact
        venue staff for assistance contacting emergency services.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most instances if you have an issue with someone’s behavior along
        the lines of this Code then please raise it; there are a few potential
        people you could raise it to depending on your situation and your
        safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most cases, issues are best resolved at the source. Accordingly,
        raising the issue with the group chair or team contact of the relevant
        group is usually the best first place to raise an issue. Group chairs
        and team contacts also have more of the context which helps them
        address the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
	You are welcome to raise issues directly with the <a>Ombudspeople</a> as a <a href=
        "mailto:ombuds@w3.org">group</a> or <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures">individually</a>. All
        complaints will be taken seriously and will receive a response.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are responsible for a community within the W3C such as in the

      <h2>
        If You've Done Something Improper
      </h2>
      <p>
        As we engage in diverse communities we may accidentally cause offense,
        whether through using unknowingly offensive terminology or through
        missing social cues.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you realize (or are told) that you have offended someone then take
        the appropriate steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Acknowledge that you've done something improper
        </li>
        <li>Briefly apologize. Don't try to explain yourself or minimize the
        issue
        </li>
        <li>If possible, edit your message, restate your communication in a
        better way or withdraw your statement. Publicly revising your statement
        helps define the culture for others
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Alice: “Yeah I used X and it was really crazy!” Eve: “Hey, could you
        not use that word? What about ‘ridiculous’ instead?” Alice: “oh sorry,
        sure.” -&gt; edits old message to say “Yeah I used X and it was really
        confusing!”
      </p>
      <p>
        This will allow conversation to quickly continue without any need of
        further action or escalating the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't understand what you did wrong, assume that the hurt party
        has good cause and accept it. We cannot know everyone's background and
        should do our best to avoid harm. You are welcome to discuss it with a
        W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures">ombudsperson</a> later.
