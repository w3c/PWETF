        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        W3C is a growing and global community where <a>participants</a> choose
        to work together. W3C is committed to maintaining a positive working
        environment, where each participant feels appreciated and respected and
        where everyone adheres to the same high level of standards of personal
        behavior. In that process we experience differences in language,
        location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment,
        misunderstandings and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be
        resolved informally.
      </p>
            <p>
        W3C's <cite>Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</cite>
        (<abbr title="Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct">CEPC</abbr>) is
        useful to define accepted and <a>acceptable behaviors</a> and to
        promote high standards of professional practice. The goal of this code
        of conduct is to ensure that W3C is an environment where everyone can
        participate without fear of <a>harassment</a>. It also provides a
        benchmark for self evaluation and acts as a vehicle for better identity
        of the organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CEPC is complemented by a set of <a href=
        "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures">Procedures</a>, applies
        to any member of the W3C community – staff, members, invited experts,
        and <a>participants</a> in W3C meetings, W3C teleconferences, W3C
        mailing lists, code repositories, W3C conferences or W3C functions, etc.
        Note that this code complements rather than replaces legal rights and
        obligations pertaining to any particular situation.

        Statement of Intent
      </h2>
      <p>
        W3C is committed to maintaining a <strong>positive</strong> work
        environment. This commitment calls for a workplace where
        <a>participants</a> at all levels behave according to the rules of the
        following code. A foundational concept of this code is that <em>we all
        share responsibility</em> for our work environment.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Code
      </h2>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Expected Behavior
        </h3>

        <p>
          Treat each other with respect,
          professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences
          and strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Appreciate and accommodate our similarities and differences. We
          come from many cultures and backgrounds, ways of life, and standards
          of behavior. Cultural differences can encompass everything from
          official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be
          respectful of people with different practices, attitudes, and
          beliefs. To help us achieve and maintain these high standards, each
          individual participant is expected to share responsibility for our
          work environment by adhering to the behavioral guidelines herein.
          </li>
          <li>Have empathy when discussing sensitive issues. Some participants
          may have experienced (or been subjected to) various forms of violence
          in their lives, which may cause distress when they are reminded of
          it. Avoid making jokes or callously mentioning sexual violence such
          as stalking or sexual assault; in cases when the need arises to
          discuss these issues and how they affect people - do so with tact and
          empathy taking into account the gravity of the situation, and make
          sure that <a>participants</a> are appropriately warned in advance so
          they can choose to step out of these discussions.
          </li>
          <li>Treat everyone with respect. We are a large community of people who are passionate
          about our work, sometimes holding strong opinions and beliefs. We are
          committed to dealing with each other with courtesy, respect, and
          dignity at all times. Misunderstandings and disagreements do happen.
          When conflicts arise, we are expected to resolve them maintaining
          that courtesy, respect, and dignity, even when emotions are
          heightened.
          </li>
          <li>Do not accept or engage in abusive behavior in any form, whether it is
        verbal, physical, sexual, or implied.</li>
          <li>Be honest. Be truthful, sincere, forthright and, unless professional duties require confidentiality or special discretion, candid, straightforward, and frank.</li>
          <li>Be inclusive and promote <a>diversity</a>. Seek diverse
          perspectives. Diversity of views and of people powers innovation,
          even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new
          perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself
          dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and
          encourage other voices to join in. Provide alternative ways to
          contribute.
          </li>
          <li>Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the
          group.
          </li>
          <li>Be aware that displays of affection may complicate professional
          relationships. For some cultures, overtly friendly disposition
          towards another participant involving body contact (e.g.: hugging,
          touching on the arm or shoulder, or kissing) is uncommon and may be
          perceived as an invasion of personal space, or as unwelcome advances.
          </li>
          <li>Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices, and discriminatory
          practices.
          </li>
          <li>Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred
          names, titles (including pronouns), and the appropriate tone of
          voice. Therefore, be formal and conservative in what you do and
          liberal in what you accept from others and acknowledge the
          contributions of your peers.
          </li>
		<li>Accommodate participants' needs for physical distancing and other accommodations or precautions due to health concerns such as immune deficiency, allergies, or chemical sensitivity.</li>
          <li>Be sensitive to language differences. English is the default
          language of the W3C. However, only some of us are native English
          speakers. Many <a>participants</a> speak English as a second (or
          third) language. People who communicate in non-native language often
          struggle to understand fast and/or quiet speech and may speak louder
          than they usually would when communicating in their native tongue. If
          someone struggles to express their thoughts, help ensure their ideas
          are adequately expressed, heard, and granted thorough consideration.
          </li>
          <li>Respect confidentiality and privacy. Sometimes, matters we discuss may
          fall under various <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/#confidentiality-levels">confidentiality</a>
          agreements and strict adherence to these agreements is expected. In
          addition, certain pieces of information disclosed in a group setting
          may be private in nature, or we may inadvertently learn confidential
          information accidentally disclosed by other participants. Please
          exercise good judgment, and make reasonable efforts to protect
          privacy and confidentiality of all participants.

          Unacceptable Behavior
        </h3>
        <p>
          <dfn>Unacceptable behaviors</dfn> run counter to the Code
          of Ethics and Professional Conduct. This list of <a>unacceptable
          behaviors</a> does not cover every case. Each person you interact
          with is unique, and behavior must be assessed on an individual level.
          Ensuring that your behavior does not have a negative impact is your
          responsibility. W3C strictly prohibits <a>discrimination</a>,
          intimidation, <a>harassment</a>, and <a>bullying</a> of any kind and
          on any basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a>Unacceptable behaviors</a> include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Offensive comments related to gender, <a>gender identity</a> and
          <a>gender expression</a>, sexual orientation, disability (both
          visible and invisible), mental health, <a>neurotype</a>, physical
          appearance, body, age, race, socio-economic status, ethnicity,
          nationality, language, or religion
          </li>
          <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and
          practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs,
          and employment
          </li>
          <li>
            <a>Misgendering</a> someone by deliberately referring to a person
            using the wrong pronouns or by using someone's proper names or
            other terms that person has asked not to be used, also known as
            <a>deadnaming</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where
          they are not appropriate.
          </li>
          <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (e.g., textual
          descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without <a>consent</a> or after
          a request to stop.
          </li>
          <li>Threats of violence.
          </li>
          <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including
          encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
          </li>
          <li>Deliberate intimidation.
          </li>
          <li>Stalking or physically following or invading someone's personal space after a request to stop.</li>
		<li>Exposing others to contagious disease</lI>
		  
		<li>
            <a>Harassing</a> photography or recording, including logging online
            activity for <a>harassment</a> purposes.
          </li>
          <li>Sustained disruption of discussion.
          </li>
          <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.
          </li>
          <li>Patterns of inappropriate social contact, such as
          requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
          </li>
          <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
          </li>
          <li>Deliberate outing of any aspect of a person’s <a>gender
          identity</a> without their <a>consent</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication without
          <a>consent</a> by the involved parties.
          </li>
          <li>Use of coded language (also known as "dog whistles") used to
          rally support for hate groups or to intimidate vulnerable groups.
          </li>
          <li>Microaggressions, which are small comments or questions, either
          intentional or unintentional, that marginalize people by
          communicating hostile, derogatory, or negative beliefs. Examples
          include:
            <ul>
              <li>Patronizing language or behavior:
                <ul>
                  <li>Be aware that, regardless of the speaker's intentions,
                  some phrases or constructions lead people to expect a
                  patronizing statement to follow, and avoid such phrases. For
                  example, beginning an interjection with "Well, actually..."
                  can set this expectation and be taken as a sign of
                  disrespect.
                  </li>
                  <li>Assuming without asking that particular people or groups
                  need concepts defined or explained to them. It’s great to be
                  sensitive to the fact that people may not be familiar with
                  technical terms you use every day, but assuming that people
                  are uninformed can come across as patronizing.
                  </li>
                  <li>Assuming that particular groups of people are technically
                  unskilled (e.g., “So easy your grandmother could do it”).
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Repeatedly interrupting or talking over someone else.
              </li>
              <li>Feigning surprise at someone’s lack of knowledge or awareness
              about a topic.
              </li>
              <li>The use of racially charged language to describe an
              individual or thing (such as “thug” or “ghetto”).
              </li>
              <li>Referring to an individual in a way that <a>demeans</a> or
              challenges the validity of their racial identity.
              </li>
              <li>Mocking someone’s real or perceived accent or first language.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Retaliating, or taking adverse action, against anyone who files a complaint that someone has

        If you are concerned about your immediate safety, contact <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emergency_telephone_numbers">local
        law enforcement</a>. For a face to face event you may need to contact
        venue staff for assistance contacting law enforcement.

      <p>
        In most instances if you have an issue with someone’s behavior along
        the lines of this Code then please raise it; there are a few potential
        people you could raise it to depending on your situation and your
        safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most cases, issues are best resolved at the source. Accordingly,
        raising the issue with the group chair or team contact of the relevant
        group is usually the best first place to raise an issue. Group chairs
        and team contacts also have more of the context which helps them
        address the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
	You are welcome to raise issues directly with the <a>Ombudspeople</a> as a <a href=
        "mailto:ombuds@w3.org">group</a> or <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures">individually</a>. All
        complaints will be taken seriously and will receive a response.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are responsible for a community within the W3C such as in the
        role of a chair of a working group and you witness <a>harassment</a> or
        any other behavior which goes against this code you are encouraged to
        address the issue directly. If you need assistance, you might get
        assistance from an <a href="mailto:ombuds@w3.org">Ombudsperson</a> or
        senior W3C management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chairs, Team Contacts, and Event Organizers should take such immediate
        action as they deem necessary in order to stop <a href=
        "#unacceptablebehavior">unacceptable behavior</a>. This action may take
        many forms, but examples may include:
