	    <li>provide a benchmark</li>
	    <li>ensure transparency in managing moderation</li>
	    <li>ensure and environment where people can participate without fear of harrassment</li>
<li>contribute to the identity of the organisation<li></ul>

      <p>
        This is an unofficial proposal.
	Refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of
	Ethics and Professional Conduct</a> for the operational

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>W3C is a <strong>growing and global community</strong> where participants
choose to work together, and it is committed to maintaining a positive working environment, where each participant feels appreciated and respected and where everyone adheres to the same high level of standards of personal behavior. In that process we experience differences in language, location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment, 
misunderstandings and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be resolved
informally.</p>
	    <ul>
<li> W3C community participants should treat each other with respect and professionalism and be mindful of cultural differences.</li>
<li>W3C community participants should communicate constructively and avoid insulting, unwelcome or demeaning behavior.</li>
<li>W3C strictly prohibits discrimination, intimidation, harassment, and bullying of any kind and on any basis.</li>
<li>W3C will act formally to eliminate abusive behavior in any form, whether it is verbal, physical, sexual, or implied.</li>
		    </ul>

<p>A <strong>Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</strong> is useful to
define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of
professional practice. The goal of this code of conduct is to ensure transparency in moderation of the working group and to ensure that the working group is an environment where everyone can participate without fear of harassment.It also provides a benchmark for self evaluation and
acts as a vehicle for better identity of the organization.</p>

<p>This code (<strong>CEPC</strong>), complemented by a set of <a
href="/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures">Procedures</a>, applies to any member of the
W3C community – staff, members, invited experts, participants in W3C
meetings, W3C teleconferences, W3C mailing lists, W3C conference or W3C
functions, etc. Note that this code complements rather than replaces legal
rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation.</p>

public homepage</a>.</p>

<h2>Statement of Intent</h2>

<p>W3C is committed to maintain a
<strong>positive</strong> work environment. This commitment calls for a
workplace where <a>participants</a> at all levels
<strong>behave</strong> according to the rules of the following code. A
foundational concept of this code is that <strong>we all share
responsibility</strong> for our <a>work environment</a>.</p>

        <strong>Unacceptable behaviour</strong>
      </h3>

	<div class="note" title="This section is a work in progress">
	<p>Including "unnacceptable behavior is new to CEPC. While we agree on the intent of this section, discussions about specific language, extent, specificity, and placement are still underway.</p>
	</div>
      <p>Some behaviors run counter to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. This list of unacceptable behaviors does not cover every case. Each person you interact with is unique, and behavior must be assessed on an individual level. Ensuring that your behavior does not have a negative impact is your responsibility. W3C strictly prohibits discrimination, intimidation, harassment, and bullying of any kind and on any basis.</p>

                <li>Assuming without asking that particular people or groups need concepts defined or explained to them. (It’s
                  great to be sensitive to the fact that people may not be familiar with technical terms you use every day,
                  but assuming that people are uninformed can come across as patronizing.)</li>

                <li>Assuming that particular groups of people are technically unskilled (“So easy your grandmother could do it.”)</li>
              </ul>

	<h3>Expected Behavior</h3>
	<div class="note" title="This section is a work in progress">
	
<ul>
  <li>Treat each other with <a>respect</a>, professionalism,
    fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences and strengths, including
    in situations of high pressure and urgency.</li>
  <li><strong>Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences</strong>We come from many cultures and backgrounds, ways of life, and standard of behavior. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different practices, attitudes, and beliefs. To help us achieve and maintain these high standards, each individual participant is expected to share responsibility for our work environment by adhering to the following behavioral guidelines:
</li>
	
	
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Respect.</strong> We are a large community of people who are passionate about our work, sometimes holding strong opinions and beliefs. We are committed to dealing with each other with courtesy, respect, and dignity at all times. Misunderstandings and disagreements do happen. When conflicts arise, we are expected to resolve them maintaining that courtesy, respect, and dignity, even when emotions are heightened.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Be inclusive and Promote Diversity.</strong> Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Provide alternative ways to contribute.</li>
		
		<li>Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group.  </li>
		
  <li>Be aware that displays of affection may complicate professional relationships. For some cultures, overtly friendly disposition towards another participant involving body contact (e.g.: hugging, touching on the arm or shoulder, or kissing) is uncommon and may be perceived as an invasion of personal space, or as unwelcome advances. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. </li>

<li>Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred names, titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Therefore, be formal and conservative in what you do and liberal in what you accept from others and acknowledge the contributions of your peers. At least until a truly friendly atmosphere and relationships are established.</li>

<li>Be sensitive to language differences. English is the default language of the W3C. However, only some of us are native English speakers. Many participants speak English as a second (or third) language. People who communicate in non-native language often struggle to understand fast and/or quiet speech, and tend to speak louder than they usually would when communicating in their native tongue. If someone struggles to express his thoughts, help ensure their ideas are adequately expressed, heard, and granted thorough consideration.</li>

<li>Confidentiality and privacy. Sometimes, matters we discuss may fall under various <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/#confidentiality-levels>confidentiality"</a>agreements and strict adherence to these agreements is expected. In addition, certain pieces of information disclosed in a group setting may be private in nature, or we may inadvertently learn confidential information accidentally disclosed by other participants. Please exercise good judgment, and make reasonable efforts to protect privacy and confidentiality of all participants.</li>
</ul>

<section id="Reporting">
	<h2>Reporting</h2>
	<p>Concerns about potential violations of the code of conduct should be reported to a W3C Ombudsperson as outlined in the complementary <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures">Procedures</a> document.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section id="mistake">
	<h2>If you've done something improper</h2>
	<p>As we engage in diverse communities we may accidentally cause offense, whether through using unknowingly offensive terminology or through missing social cues.</p>
<p>If you realise (or are told) that you have offended someone then take the appropriate steps:
<ol>
	<li>Acknowledge that you've done something improper</li>
	<li>Briefly apologize. Don't try to explain yourself or minimise the issue.</li>
<li>If possible, edit your message, restate your communication in a better way or withdraw your statement. Publicly revising your statement helps define the culture for others.</li></ul>

	<p>Alice: “Yeah I used X and it was really crazy!” Eve: “Hey, could you not use that word? What about ‘ridiculous’ instead?” Alice: “oh sorry, sure.” -> edits old message to say “Yeah I used X and it was really confusing!”</p>
<p>This will allow conversation to quickly continue without any need of further action or escalating the situation.</p>
<p>If you don't understand what you did wrong, assume the the hurt party has good cause and accept it. We cannot know everyone's background and should do our best to avoid harm. You are welcome to discuss it with a W3C ombudsperson later.</p>
