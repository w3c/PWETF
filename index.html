  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>W3C is a <strong>growing and global community</strong> where participants
      choose to work together, and it is committed to maintaining a positive working environment, where each participant
      feels appreciated and respected and where everyone adheres to the same high level of standards of personal
      behavior. In that process we experience differences in language, location, nationality, and experience. In such a
      diverse environment,
      misunderstandings and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be resolved
      informally.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> W3C community participants should treat each other with respect and professionalism and be mindful of
        cultural differences.</li>
      <li>W3C community participants should communicate constructively and avoid insulting, unwelcome or demeaning
        behavior.</li>
      <li>W3C strictly prohibits discrimination, intimidation, harassment, and bullying of any kind and on any basis.
      </li>
      <li>W3C will act formally to eliminate abusive behavior in any form, whether it is verbal, physical, sexual, or
        implied.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A <strong>Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</strong> is useful to
      define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of
      professional practice. The goal of this code of conduct is to ensure transparency in moderation of the working
      group and to ensure that the working group is an environment where everyone can participate without fear of
      harassment.It also provides a benchmark for self evaluation and
      acts as a vehicle for better identity of the organization.</p>

    <p>This code (<strong>CEPC</strong>), complemented by a set of <a href="/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures">Procedures</a>,
      applies to any member of the
      W3C community – staff, members, invited experts, participants in W3C
      meetings, W3C teleconferences, W3C mailing lists, W3C conference or W3C
      functions, etc. Note that this code complements rather than replaces legal
      rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation.</p>

    <p><a href="/Consortium/pwe/#Education">Education and training materials</a>
      are available from the <a href="/Consortium/pwe/">Positive Work Environment
        public homepage</a>.</p>

    <h2>Statement of Intent</h2>

    <p>W3C is committed to maintain a
      <strong>positive</strong> work environment. This commitment calls for a
      workplace where <a>participants</a> at all levels
      <strong>behave</strong> according to the rules of the following code. A
      foundational concept of this code is that <strong>we all share
        responsibility</strong> for our <a>work environment</a>.</p>

    <h2>Code</h2>

    <h3 id="unacceptablebehaviour">
      <strong>Unacceptable behaviour</strong>
    </h3>

    <div class="note" title="This section is a work in progress">
      <p>Including "unnacceptable behavior is new to CEPC. While we agree on the intent of this section, discussions
        about specific language, extent, specificity, and placement are still underway.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Some behaviors run counter to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. This list of unacceptable behaviors
      does not cover every case. Each person you interact with is unique, and behavior must be assessed on an individual
      level. Ensuring that your behavior does not have a negative impact is your responsibility. W3C strictly prohibits
      discrimination, intimidation, harassment, and bullying of any kind and on any basis.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental
        illness,
        neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, socio-economic status, ethnicity, nationality, language, or
        religion</li>

      <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food,
        health,
        parenting, drugs, and employment</li>

      <li>Misgendering someone by deliberately referring to a person using their wrong pronouns. Or by using someone's
        proper names or other terms that person has asked not to be used, also known as dead-naming.</li>

      <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they are not appropriate</li>

      <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (e.g., textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without
        consent
        or after a request to stop</li>

      <li>Threats of violence</li>

      <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage
        in self-harm</li>

      <li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes</li>

      <li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>

      <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>

      <li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with
        others</li>

      <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>

      <li>Deliberate outing of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect

        community members or other vulnerable people from intentional abuse</li>

      <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication without consent by the involved parties</li>

      <li>Use of coded language (also known as "dog whistles") used to rally support for hate groups or to intimidate
        vulnerable groups.</li>

      <li>Microaggressions, which are small comments or questions, either intentional or unintentional, that marginalize
        people
        by communicating hostile, derogatory, or negative beliefs. Examples include


        <ul>
          <li>Patronizing language or behavior
            <ul>
              <li>Be aware that, regardless of the speaker's intentions, some phrases or constructions lead people to
                expect a patronizing statement to follow, and avoid such phrases. For example, beginning an interjection
                with "Well actually..." can set this expectation, and be taken as a sign of disrespect.</li>

              <li>Assuming without asking that particular people or groups need concepts defined or explained to them.
                (It’s
                great to be sensitive to the fact that people may not be familiar with technical terms you use every
                day,
                but assuming that people are uninformed can come across as patronizing.)</li>

              <li>Assuming that particular groups of people are technically unskilled (“So easy your grandmother could
                do it.”)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Repeatedly interrupting or talking over someone else</li>

          <li>Referring to an individual in a way that demeans or challenges the validity of their racial identity</li>

          <li>Mocking someone’s real or perceived accent or first language</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Retaliating against anyone who files a complaint that someone has violated this code of conduct.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The enforcers of this Code should prioritise the safety of individuals within marginalised communities over the
      comfort of others,
      and reserve the rights not to take further actions on complaints regarding:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’</li>

      <li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with
        you.”</li>

      <li>Communication in a tone you don’t find congenial</li>

      <li>Criticisms of racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behaviour or assumptions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Expected Behavior</h3>
    <div class="note" title="This section is a work in progress">

      <ul>
        <li>Treat each other with <a>respect</a>, professionalism,
          fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences and strengths, including
          in situations of high pressure and urgency.</li>

        <li><strong>Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences</strong> We come from many cultures and
          backgrounds, ways of life, and standard of behavior. Cultural differences can encompass everything from
          official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different
          practices, attitudes, and beliefs. To help us achieve and maintain these high standards, each individual
          participant is expected to share responsibility for our work environment by adhering to the following
          behavioral guidelines:
        </li>

        <li><strong>Have empathy when discussing sensitive issues</strong>
          Some participants may have experienced (or been subjected to) various forms of violence in their lives, which may cause distress when they are reminded of it. Avoid making jokes or callously mentioning sexual violence such as stalking or sexual assault; in cases when the need arises to discuss these issues and how they affect people - do so with tact and empathy taking into account the gravity of the situation, and make sure that participants are appropriately warned in advance so they can choose to step out of these discussions.
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Respect.</strong> We are a large community of people who are passionate about our work, sometimes
          holding strong opinions and beliefs. We are committed to dealing with each other with courtesy, respect, and
          dignity at all times. Misunderstandings and disagreements do happen. When conflicts arise, we are expected
          to resolve them maintaining that courtesy, respect, and dignity, even when emotions are heightened.</li>

        <li><strong>Be inclusive and Promote Diversity.</strong> Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of
          people powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives
          be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to
          step back and encourage other voices to join in. Provide alternative ways to contribute.</li>

        <li>Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. </li>

        <li>Be aware that displays of affection may complicate professional relationships. For some cultures, overtly
          friendly disposition towards another participant involving body contact (e.g.: hugging, touching on the arm
          or shoulder, or kissing) is uncommon and may be perceived as an invasion of personal space, or as unwelcome
          advances. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. </li>

        <li>Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred names, titles (including pronouns) and the
          appropriate tone of voice. Therefore, be formal and conservative in what you do and liberal in what you
          accept from others and acknowledge the contributions of your peers. At least until a truly friendly
          atmosphere and relationships are established.</li>

        <li>Be sensitive to language differences. English is the default language of the W3C. However, only some of us
          are native English speakers. Many participants speak English as a second (or third) language. People who
          communicate in non-native language often struggle to understand fast and/or quiet speech, and tend to speak
          louder than they usually would when communicating in their native tongue. If someone struggles to express
          his thoughts, help ensure their ideas are adequately expressed, heard, and granted thorough consideration.
        </li>

        <li>Confidentiality and privacy. Sometimes, matters we discuss may fall under various <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/#confidentiality-levels">confidentiality</a> agreements and
            strict adherence to these agreements is expected. In addition, certain pieces of information disclosed in a
            group setting may be private in nature, or we may inadvertently learn confidential information accidentally
            disclosed by other participants. Please exercise good judgment, and make reasonable efforts to protect
            privacy and confidentiality of all participants.

  <section id="Reporting">
    <h2>Reporting</h2>
    <p>If you are concerned about your immediate safety, contact local law enforcement.
      For a face to face event you may need to contact venue staff for assistance contacting them.</p>
    <p>You may also contact a W3C ombud who will assist you: <a href="mailto:ombuds@w3.org">ombuds@w3.org</a>.</p>

    <p>If you have an issue with someone’s behaviour along the lines of this Code then please raise it, there
      are a few potential people you could raise it to depending on your situation and your safety.</p>

    <p>You are welcome to raise issues directly with the <a href="mailto:ombuds@w3.org">Ombuds</a> who
      will assist you. All complaints will be taken seriously and will receive a response.</p>

    <p>If it is applicable, You may instead choose to raise issues with a chair of the group. A group chair will have
      more context so may be better able to assist you. If they do not feel able to assist you, they should help you raise
      the issue with an Ombuds person. You may also ask for them to help you raise it to an Ombuds person immediately
      if you do not feel comfortable contacting the Ombuds directly. 
    </p>

    <p>If you are responsible for a community within the W3C such as a chair of a working group and you witness harassment or
      any other behaviour which goes against this code you are encouraged to raise issues directly with
      an <a href="mailto:ombuds@w3.org">Ombuds</a> person who can assist you.

    <h2>If you've done something improper</h2>
    <p>As we engage in diverse communities we may accidentally cause offense, whether through using unknowingly
      offensive terminology or through missing social cues.</p>
    <p>If you realise (or are told) that you have offended someone then take the appropriate steps:
      <ol>
        <li>Acknowledge that you've done something improper</li>
        <li>Briefly apologize. Don't try to explain yourself or minimise the issue.</li>
        <li>If possible, edit your message, restate your communication in a better way or withdraw your statement.
          Publicly revising your statement helps define the culture for others.</li>
      </ol>

        <p>Alice: “Yeah I used X and it was really crazy!” Eve: “Hey, could you not use that word? What about
          ‘ridiculous’ instead?” Alice: “oh sorry, sure.” -> edits old message to say “Yeah I used X and it was really
          confusing!”</p>
        <p>This will allow conversation to quickly continue without any need of further action or escalating the
          situation.</p>
        <p>If you don't understand what you did wrong, assume the the hurt party has good cause and accept it. We cannot
          know everyone's background and should do our best to avoid harm. You are welcome to discuss it with a W3C
          ombudsperson later.</p>
