# W3C Discussion Forum Moderation Guidance

Every email list, issues list or other discussion forum creates an obligation to ensure that it is not used for harmful purposes.
By default, a forum's moderators are the group's chairs, maintainers or W3C administrators, 
but specific individuals may also be appointed as moderators.  The purpose of moderation is to ensure that the forum is used in keeping with W3C's mission and values.

## Moderator Guidelines

Moderation of a discussion forum typically requires only a very light touch.

Often helpful:
- Start productive conversations.
- Thank authors for particularly insightful posts.  This can be done privately, but occasional public accolades are also helpful.
- Gently guide conversations in a more productive direction if they get too far off track.
- Guide discussions toward actionable closure.

Other responsibilities:
- Follow all posted content, at least enough to notice whether any content violates W3C policies.
- Ensure that participants abide by the [W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/) (CEPC).  
- If a suspected violation of the CEPC occurs, refer to the [Dispute Resolution Guidance](https://github.com/w3c/PWETF/blob/main/DisputeResolution.md) for handling it.
- Remove malware links and spam.
