# TPAC Inclusion Fund Proposal and Comms Plan

May 2022, 
v. 2

## TPAC Inclusion Fund proposed update 
The goals of this proposal are to:
* increase the diversity of attendees represented at <abbr title="Technical Plenary Advisory Committee meetings">TPAC</abbr> 
* increase the diversity of attendees who can make meaningful contributions to web standards, at TPAC and beyond
* ease the administrative burden and time pressure of administering the fund

This proposal builds on the previous work and use of the TPAC Diversity Fund in 2020.

Increasing representation
To increase the representation at TPAC, W3C should use the inclusion fund to run:
* Inclusion Fund: continue the use of the fund to help W3C members to attend, through assistance with technology needs or to reduce the barriers that would prevent them from attending and participating
* TPAC Fellow: a honorarium aimed at those from under represented backgrounds who may not have ability to prioritise a meaningful contribution without financial support.

The Inclusion Fund would follow broadly the same structure as the 2020 Fund, with minor amends made to the administrative process, application form and comms.

The TPAC Fellow honorarium would be $500, paid to the fellow to prepare and contribute to TPAC in a meaningful way. It is proposed that there be a maximum of 3-5 TPAC fellows.

### Streamlining the administration of the Inclusion Fund
There is a significant time pressure to ask for contributions to the fund alongside the need to:
* run the application process for the fund
* assess the applications
* pay the funds in a reasonable time for TPAC

It is suggested, given the balance remaining in the TPAC 2020 Diversity Fund, that grants be made from existing funds, and requests for donation be made to support the succeeding year’s grants. So for example, the request for donations for this year would contribute to the 2022 fund, while 2021 grants would be supported by 2020 contributions.

This way, the process for applying and distributing the funds can be based on a known quantity of funds for any given year. 

In addition, it is suggested that 3 nominated individuals from the [Positive Work Environment Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/pwe/) manage the short listing of candidates for both funds. Decisions on the funds will be made jointly by representatives from the W3C Management and the Positive Work Environment Community Group (in order to keep the decision-making loop streamlined and prioritised). 

## Inclusion Fund
This fund operates the same as the previous TPAC fund - helping those with particular barriers to attend TPAC. The details of the fund are in the application form introduction and eligibility section. 

Application form
Introduction

W3C wants to be a model of supporting greater diversity in bringing people together to develop web technology. [60% of the world is online](https://datareportal.com/reports/6-in-10-people-around-the-world-now-use-the-internet) and is growing every year. We want to reflect the diversity of the whole world as more people continue to access, use and create the web.

W3C has established a TPAC Inclusion Fund, sponsored this year by W3C, [donors]. W3C uses this fund to help remove barriers for those who want to attend or contribute to TPAC in a meaningful way.

Examples of what the Inclusion Fund might help to cover:
* technology to participate more effectively online
* help with paying internet costs
* child care (or care for a relative)
* noise cancelling headphones if you need quiet to concentrate 
* co-working space if you don’t have room at your office or home
* travel to TPAC
* costs associated with in-person attendance 

If there are other types of help you think would apply to your situation, please explain in your application. 

#### Eligibility
In order to apply for the TPAC Inclusion Fund, you should:
* be from a group that is under-represented in the web community
* unable to participate in TPAC without financial help

The definition of "under-represented" means different things to different people, and may be different depending on where you are. For example, it can include: 
* people with disabilities
* people of color 
* indigenous people
* women
* LGBTQ+ people
* people from outside of Europe and North America
* people from a lower socioeconomic background
* refugees

These examples may be geographically or community-specific, so we encourage anyone who feels they meet the definition of underrepresented that is relevant to their geography or culture to apply for this fund.

You will need a W3C account to submit your application.

If you have questions about your eligibility, or have difficulty using this form, you can send your answers by email to group-diversity@w3.org.

How applications are assessed

W3C reviewers will prioritise:
* new W3C participants and established participants who have not previously attended TPAC
* diversity among the applications, where that can be determined

Three people from the Positive Work Environment Community Group will short list candidates for both funds. Decisions on the funds will be made jointly by two representatives from the W3C Management and the three members of the Positive Work Environment Community Group.

Your applications won’t be judged on their written quality, in case it’s hard for you to complete, for example if English is your second language or you have a disability.

Information supplied in this form will be submitted to the inclusion fund selection committee and stored on W3C's servers and is subject to [W3C Privacy Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/privacy-statement).

#### Timeline

The important dates are:
* applications open on xx May 2022
* applications close on xx July 2022
* successful applicants notified by xx August 2022

#### Application

* What communities do you participate in at the W3C?

* What perspectives will you bring to TPAC and what areas would you like to contribute to?

Please provide as much information as you’re comfortable sharing about the under-represented perspectives you would bring to TPAC.

* Are you in any W3C working, interest, or community groups?

* What organization are you from or participating on behalf of?

* What will you use the fund for?
You should also consider any funding from your company or organisation to attend this event. Please include a breakdown of costs.

* Links (Linked In/website)

* Any other information to support your application

## TPAC Fellows honorarium
The goal of the TPAC Fellows honorarium is to support those members of TPAC who may not have the wider support from their organisation to dedicate to W3C goals. 

As W3C wants to increase diversity, it can show that it values diversity and the contribution to W3C to offer an honorarium, to pay for the work that members will have to do outside of their work to contribute in a meaningful way.

Meaningful could mean:
* pitching and running a particular session
* preparing documents such as explainers or drafts for discussion
* reviewing a group’s work and preparing comments for discussion
* presenting on an implementation of a group's work

Contributions can be on any topic that is appropriate for TPAC, and don’t specifically have to focus on diversity. The goal of the honorarium is to increase representation by those from underrepresented groups in all aspects of the W3C.

## Generic comms/TPAC page
60% of the world is online and we want and need to reflect the diversity of the whole world as more people continue to access, use and create the web. We believe that more diversity means better representation, which leads to better and more inclusive design. Indeed, more background, more use cases, more edge cases, lead to a better Web. More diversity also brings higher quality results.

We aspire to be a model in supporting greater diversity in technology. We continue to have a long way to go but we have taken steps and are doing the background work so that we both attract more diverse participants and also encourage them to be welcome in our environment.

The W3C [TPAC Inclusion Fund's applications](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/1/InclusionFund2021/) are open between @@ May and @@ July. In August the new TPAC Fellows honorarium of US$ 500 will be awarded to a few to cover work towards W3C goals done outside of their habitual work. We encourage you to apply if you feel you are from an underrepresented group and wouldn’t be able to attend or meaningfully contribute to TPAC without financial support.

If there are other types of help you think would be appropriate in your case, you can still apply and explain the reason in your application. 

The TPAC Inclusion Fund is sponsored by W3C, [donors]. If your organization would like to become a sponsor, contact us via group-diversity@w3.org.

Please, read more in the 2021 update on Diversity and Inclusion at W3C via our [CEO blog post](URL).

## Email to groups
Initial email

Dear Chairs,

As you know TPAC is taking place on 12-16 September and just today we have announced the Inclusion Fund and Fellowships for TPAC 2022 via our [CEO blog post](URL). Applications for the former opened today. The Fellowships application will open in September.

We want to get as many people to TPAC as we can, which is why we’re hoping you could communicate the Inclusion Fund and the TPAC Fellows honorarium to your group(s).

We’d really appreciate if you could mention these at your next meetings and encourage anyone who has questions to get in touch with the Positive Work Environment Community Group via public-pwe@w3.org.

Also, please tweet or share this information with your teams, your friends that are concerned with TPAC participation, on your social networks, enterprise networks, at virtual meet-ups, etc. Also, consider encouraging someone directly if you think W3C could benefit from their attendance at TPAC.

Thanks!

## Email to sponsors

Dear Advisory Committee representative, Chairs,

In this call for sponsors, I would like to draw your attention to the topic of diversity in tech --a topic that we started to pay particular attention to in 2018, spurred by W3C Member Samsung Electronics. Indeed, we really need W3C Members to buy into this if we want to truly be the model in supporting greater diversity in technology that we aspire to become. The diversity of the whole world needs to be reflected, as 60% of the world is now online and as more people continue to access and use the Web that we develop the standards of, here together at the Web Consortium.

For TPAC 2022 we continue to offer an Inclusion Fund (formerly "Diversity Fund") to ensure that people can attend, for example through assistive technology or caring support. We made some changes to the process in order to ensure that:
* applicants have enough time to apply and receive fund in time for TPAC
* ease the administrative burden and time pressure for managing the fund

Applications for the TPAC 2022 Inclusion Fund closed a few days ago, and we will notify the successful applicants by @@ August 2022. We will open the Fellowships application in September when the TPAC 2022 registration opens, aiming to award three to five Honoraria. You can read more about Fellowships in Jeff's post [@@], including about the successful 8 breakout sessions that last year's fund supported and which explored the intersection of W3C technologies and the challenges facing underrepresented communities in using or shaping them to their needs.

Because still have some money left in the Fund, we suggest to run the fund retrospectively: Your sponsorships this year will affect next year’s fund. This will allow applications, scrutiny, decision and payment of the successful applications. 

W3C has approved a contribute of $5,000 toward the TPAC Inclusion Fund. Sponsors in the past have typically donated US $1,500 (or equivalent in local currency) and we hope new sponsors will join continuing sponsors.

Financial commitments made by [date] will be announced at the Advisory Committee Meeting and following TPAC.

Kind regards,
Coralie Mercier, Head of W3C Marketing & Communications
