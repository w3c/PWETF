# Positive Work Environment Community Group

W3C is a global community where participants choose to work together. In that community, we experience differences in language, location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment, misunderstandings and disagreements happen, and in most cases can be resolved informally.

This is the GitHub repository for the [Positive Work Environment Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/pwe/).

The CG picks up the work of the former [PWE Task Force](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/). 

Chairs: Tzviya Siegman, Wendy Reid

This group maintains the W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, the draft version of the document can be read directly at [https://w3c.github.io/PWETF/](https://w3c.github.io/PWETF/).

This group functions under the [W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).

If you are interested is contributing to CEPC or our other projects, please see our [contributing guide](https://github.com/w3c/PWETF/blob/main/contributing.md).
