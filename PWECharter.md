# PWE Community Group Charter

## Mission

The mission of the Positive Work Environment Community Group is to create an environment of belonging for all participants in the World Wide Consortium and to increase the presence of under-represented groups at the W3C. We believe that we strengthen W3C culture by supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion.

## Goals
Our goals are to:

* manage the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (CEPC) and its associated and procedures, including the Ombudsperson program
* provide a space to share experiences and information;
* produce best practices and use case documents regarding gathering data, reporting/feedback mechanisms, and practical ways to support each other; (data collection)
* make recommendations to the W3C for specific actions and changes to our working environment to better support inclusion and diversity

## Chair Selection

Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace their Chair(s) at any time using whatever means they prefer. However, if 5 participants, no two from the same organisation, call for an election, the group must use the following process to replace any current Chair(s) with a new Chair, consulting the Community Development Lead on election operations (e.g., voting infrastructure and using RFC 2777).

Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days to announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as all participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes.
Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted. The individual who receives the most votes, no two from the same organisation, is elected chair. In case of a tie, RFC2777 is used to break the tie. An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.
Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead, after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.
